        "***I recommend the second metric to rank states*** on how much federal financial aid they receive relative to other states. The main reason is that the metric 2 considers the population.\n",
        "\n",
        "The second metric represents the financial federal aid every person can receive in the state compared to the federal average level and it takes populations of states into consideration. Take the state of Pennsylvania as an example, the per capita is 151.76 dollars. The average per capita of the whole federal is 175.41 dollars. So the ratio is around 0.87. This number is smaller than 1, which represents that compared to the national level, people in Pennsylvania receive less. The second metric uses such method to make comparsions among states.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "*   ***It contains both revenues and population data.*** Metric 1 only considers revenues regardless of the number of people living in the area. Since the beneficiary of the financial aid is citizens, we should take population sizes into consideration when making comparisons.\n",
        "*   ***It weakens the effect of gaps in economic development levels in each state and the impact of the local people's enthusiasm for joining in education funding.*** When using Metric 1, the proportion of federal funding is linked with the other two parts - local funding and state funding. In some economically developed states, the state government may invest more money in education. And some states may have many citizens who are more willing to put their money in education. The increasing in these numbers will reduce the proportion of federal funding, but it does not mean that the federal supports less on the state. Metric 2 can avoid this situation.\n",

        "I want to explore more in two questions. ***The first one is the share of each state's education budget in the state's total annual financial budget, which gives me ideas on the importance of developing education from the perspective of government finance. The second one is the components of expenses, then finding out which parts of education spend more.***\n",
        "\n",
        "The first questiuon is to study the proportion of education budget in the total budget. Through the proportions, we can compare the distribution of government budgets in different states. The question is interesting because we can understand the relative importance of education through the perspective of budget allocation. Data analysts can compare budget allocations in different fields, and then assess wherther the budget is adequate according to the actual expenditures, and whether it is necessary to further increase the budget in the future development. \n",
        "\n",
        "The second question is to study the expenditure details of education expenses in public school districts and states. I think this question is interesting because it helps me have a basic understanding of the expenses structure and understand which parts pf education cost more than others. Data analysts can further analyze the cost details, understand the efficiency of capital use and budget priorities, and then make targeted policy recommendations, such as where to increase inputs and how to improve capital efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the first question, we have had funding and expenses data. We still need the total budget of each state and the budget in other public areas, such as infrastructure budget, culture affairs budget, technology budget and so on. We can easily use proportion of education budget in each state to proceed the analysis. And the proportion of education budget is equal to state's education budget divided by total annual budget of the state. Through the ratio, we can rank the states to find out states which spend more on education than others. Also, we judge whether the current budget can meet the needs and how to make the following policies.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the second question, now we only have the total expenses of each public school district. We need more detailed data to conduct analyses. The existd data cannot meet our needs. Key components of expenses, such as faculty expenditure, facilities expenditure, expenses on different levels of education period, such as primary, secondary, high school, etc. From the data, we can easily get the proportion by using the division formula. When we get the results, we can compare school districts and states, and observe the differences and key parts of expenditure in each state. "
